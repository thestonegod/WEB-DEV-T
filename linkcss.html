    <h2>The Girl Who Can</h2>
  <p class="">Yep there live a girl who can. she did her best to 
    utilise every resource she had.</p> 
    <p>She did her best in all but it was never enough.She wasn't trying to be enough for anyone but herslf</p> 
    <p> She <em>knows</em> she isn't the best, but she knows she the best compared to nobody.
    She is the girl who can not because she is capable of all, but
 because she tries her best in all</p>
<p>She is my girl and I LOVE HER in capital letters (Sober)</p>
